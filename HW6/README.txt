Researchers at General Motors analyzed data on 56 US Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas to study whether air pollution contributes to mortality. These
data are available in the attached data file. The response variable is the age adjusted mortality per 100,000 population (Mort). The dataset includes predictor variables measuring demographic characteristics of the cities, climate characteristics, and concentrations of the air pollutant nitrous oxide (NOx ).
