Use the attached data to come up the best multiple regression model.

Start by firstly exploring data.
Use pairs plots for numerical explanatory variables and boxplots for categorical explanatory variable to find out the ones that seem to be related to the response variable. Do not forget to comment on each plot. What insights about the response, predictors, and their relations have you gotten?
Propose a multiple regression model.
Are response and at least one of the predictors are related? Explain.
How good does your model fit to the data? Explain. Do not forget to check the diagnostic plots.
Which predictors are significant? Explain.
How much does the expected price change if a car's age increases by one year while everything else are fixed?
Can the expected car price change in response to change in age be different for different fuel types? What does data exploration suggest? Construct an appropriate new model and statistical hypothesis. Test the hypothesis.
Predict the expected price and give its 80% confidence interval for a typical car with all features set to their sample means for the numerical predictors and to the most frequent categories for the categorical predictors.
